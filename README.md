# Neural-Network-in-TensorFlow
This is a basic Neural Network written in TensorFlow that is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database. The program I have written can be previewed on GitHub without having to download any documents. It is meant to be a demonstration of my knowledge and skills in machine learning. The model typically achieves an accuracy of >97% on the test set, which, while being lower than human level performance, is a good performance from an algorithm. 

This project was based on the "Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow" guided project on Coursera. This notebook was written entirely by me, and is different from the original project I completed on Coursera, but it is important to note that the idea for this project was not my own.
