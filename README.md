# Neural-Network-in-TensorFlow
This is a basic Neural Network written in TensorFlow that is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database. It is meant to be a demonstration of my knowledge and skills in machine learning. The model typically achieves an accuracy of >97% on the test set, which, while being lower than human level performance, is a good performance from an algorithm.
